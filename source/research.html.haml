	%h3 Gathering Data
	.text_content
		%p We started our data gathering with 2 main goals: identifying the main messages to convey in order to explain how the biodiversity can help the economic sustainability and understand how we could influence our target audience.
		%p Keeping our goals in mind we did literature review to research about how to influence people and competitive analysis to identify what has been done in other countries and regions to increase environmental awareness.
		%p We did field research with our main target groups (farmer, fishermen, locals and tourists) and used several HCI techniques that were combined according to the target and the information we needed to obtain.

	%h3 Consolidating Data
	.text_content
		%p After gathering the data, we started to analyze the data collected with each group in order to synthetize the main findings for each group. 
		%p We then focused on looking at how the groups interacted and influenced each other in order to understand the relations between the groups.
		%p During this phase of the research we used HCI techniques to consolidate data such as: affinity diagraming to cluster the notes and modeling to synthetize the data and map cultural influences and the direct and indirect relation between target groups

	%h3 Findings
	.text_content
		%p Based on the data that we synthetized, we started to draw insights. Even though our user groups are very different, there are several touch points between them, and the same principle can be observed in different contexts in different user groups.
		%figure
			%img{:src=>'images/main-findings.jpg'}
			%figcaption Main findings that apply to our target groups and that will be guiding our design process
		%p We also needed to take into consideration the main motivation of each of our target groups in order to appeal to what they value as we created a solution to address our problem:
		%ul
			%li Fishermen like to have more fish and especially to sell it for a profitable cost. 
			%li Farmer’s need for water drives their actions. The correlation between water and the forest however, seems unknown to them. For them the forest is just a way to gather ingredients to make natural fertilizer. 
			%li Tourists’ reactions seemed very open to ecofriendly approaches as long as they still get to enjoy their vacation in a relaxing and fun way.

	%h3 Concept
	.text_content
		%p Based on the information gathered during the research the team created the concept for the final product.
		%p Our concept is based in 4 principles:
		%ul
			%li Inform people of the consequences of their actions 
			%li Influence people to change their behavior
			%li Create a mobile solution that can be taken to the communities
			%li Have the message be shown everyday in a persistent manner

	.text_content
		%p The team used an iterative designed technique and had 2 rounds of prototyping and testing of the product.
		%figure

			%figcaption The team did testing with the target groups in their community
		%p The 1st round of prototype and testing was done using a paper prototype and the main goal was to test the concept and the interaction for the webapp and the content in the set of playing cards
		%figure
			%img{:src=>'images/prototype.png'}
			%figcaption The team constructed a cardboard device to test the concept for progressing in the adventure
		%p The 2nd round of prototype and testing was done using a medium fidelity prototype and the main goal was to test the design and the interaction for the webapp and the location of the information on the playing cards
		%figure
			%img{:src=>'images/cards.jpg'}
			%figcaption The team designed a prototype of the playing cards that contained very specific information and used the elements made by the children to engage the players
		%p The 3rd round of prototyping and testing was done using a high fidelity prototype and the main goal was to test the tutorial that explained to the users how the selection tool worked and the playability of the set of cards
